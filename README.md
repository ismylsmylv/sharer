**About Sharer**
Welcome to Sharer!

I'm Ismayil Ismayilov, the developer behind this platform. Sharer is a personal project that I've created as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills and passion for web development. This platform aims to provide users with a seamless and reliable way to download game and app APKs.

**Project Highlights**
Technology Stack: The project is built using Next.js and TypeScript, ensuring a modern and efficient development process. Firebase powers the backend, offering real-time capabilities, while Amazon S3 is used for secure and scalable file storage.
User Experience: My focus has been on creating a user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and quick access to the latest and most popular APKs.
Performance: Leveraging the infrastructure of Firebase and Amazon S3, Sharer ensures fast and secure file delivery.
